# Personal Loan Prediction using Decision Trees

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: The project aims to predict personal loan eligibility using machine learning techniques, specifically Decision Trees, to make better lending decisions for banks.
- **Importance**: Banks’ profits depend on selecting genuine applicants who are likely to repay loans, and this system helps in automating and improving that selection process.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The research focuses on the use of **Decision Trees** for forecasting loans and improving the selection of eligible applicants.

## Research Goals
1. Develop and evaluate supervised learning systems for predicting **Personal Loan** eligibility.
2. Implement the system using **Decision Trees** to assess loan eligibility.
3. Improve loan decision-making processes through accurate predictions.

## Scope of Work
- **Risk Assessment**: The system helps in assessing the borrower’s financial skills and the associated risks of granting a loan.
- **Eligibility Determination**: It evaluates whether a loan can be provided under feasible terms based on the borrower’s ability and willingness to repay.
- **Loan Evaluation**: The system checks the borrower’s eligibility against predefined criteria to ensure sound lending decisions.

## CIBIL Score
- **CIBIL Score**: A **CIBIL Score** (Credit Information Bureau India Limited) is a three-digit number that represents a borrower’s creditworthiness. It ranges from 300 to 900, with a higher score indicating a better credit history and lower risk to lenders.
- **Importance**: A higher CIBIL score suggests that the borrower has a good history of repaying loans and credit, making them more likely to be eligible for a loan. Lenders use the score to assess the risk of lending money to individuals.
