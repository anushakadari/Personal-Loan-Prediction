Project Overview:
Objective: The project aims to predict personal loan eligibility using machine learning techniques, specifically Decision Trees, to make better lending decisions for banks.
Importance: Banks’ profits depend on selecting genuine applicants who are likely to repay loans, and this system helps in automating and improving that selection process.
Machine Learning Model: The research focuses on the use of Decision Trees for forecasting loans and improving the selection of eligible applicants.
Research Goals:
Develop and evaluate supervised learning systems for predicting Personal Loan eligibility.
Implement the system using Decision Trees to assess loan eligibility.
Improve loan decision-making processes through accurate predictions.
Scope of Work:
Risk Assessment: The system helps in assessing the borrower’s financial skills and the associated risks of granting a loan.
Eligibility Determination: It evaluates whether a loan can be provided under feasible terms based on the borrower’s ability and willingness to repay.
Loan Evaluation: The system checks the borrower’s eligibility against predefined criteria to ensure sound lending decisions.
